<h4>We're gonna work on a game of FLAG FREEZE TAG! The rules of FFT are: </h4>


There are two teams of players. One team is designated the 'runners' and the other the 'chasers'. There's also a flag in the game. <br>

Chasers can tag a runner and they become 'frozen'. You aren't allowed to tag anyone when you're frozen. <br>

Runners can tag other runners and they are no longer 'frozen'. Runners tagging chasers doesn't do anything and is considered a very risky play by freeze tag professionals.<br>

Chasers win when all runners are frozen. Runners win if one of the players picks up the flag.<br>

You should write some code to make it so that you can create teams of players and have them interact with each other.<br>

<h1>Creating your objects</h1>

There's a good bit of data here, and you should build a few different types of objects to help keep it organized. I'd recommend at least having:<br>

- a Player type
- a Team type
- maybe a Flag type


Put each of these constructors in their own module and export them. These types should have at least the following functions-
