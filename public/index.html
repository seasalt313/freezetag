    <h4>We&#39;re gonna work on a game of FLAG FREEZE TAG! The rules of FFT are: </h4>


    <p>There are two teams of players. One team is designated the &#39;runners&#39; and the other the &#39;chasers&#39;. There&#39;s also a flag in the game. <br></p>
    <p>Chasers can tag a runner and they become &#39;frozen&#39;. You aren&#39;t allowed to tag anyone when you&#39;re frozen. <br></p>
    <p>Runners can tag other runners and they are no longer &#39;frozen&#39;. Runners tagging chasers doesn&#39;t do anything and is considered a very risky play by freeze tag professionals.<br></p>
    <p>Chasers win when all runners are frozen. Runners win if one of the players picks up the flag.<br></p>
    <p>You should write some code to make it so that you can create teams of players and have them interact with each other.<br></p>
    <h1>Creating your objects</h1>

    <p>There&#39;s a good bit of data here, and you should build a few different types of objects to help keep it organized. I&#39;d recommend at least having:<br></p>
    <ul>
    <li>a Player type</li>
    <li>a Team type</li>
    <li>maybe a Flag type</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Put each of these constructors in their own module and export them. These types should have at least the following functions-</p>


    <script src="app.js" type="text/javascript">
    </script>
